* Steps in order
The plan of attack for this is going to be to add the parts slowly but
surely, making sure compatibility with the tests is maintained where
possible.
** DONE Update DomainParser middleware
Though for now, only update it so that it puts `installationName` in
the `req`.
** DONE Give all installation models the namespace of M
*** DONE Do so
*** DONE Update models so they use models in M
*** DONE Update controllers so they use models in M
*** DONE Update middlewares so they use models in M
*** DONE Update tests so they use models in M
** DONE Add DomainContainer middleware
Just add it, don't use it anywhere yet.  No mailers yet.
** DONE Implement new mailer structure
Referring to the fact that there's the InstallationManager mailers and
the Installation mailers, separate these two.
** TODO Update controllers to use DomainContainer
** TODO Update middlewares to use DomainContainer
** TODO Remove req.knex stuff
** TODO Make models not use mailers during tests
** TODO Make mailers instance based
*** TODO Do so
*** TODO Put them in DomainContainer with modelExtras
*** TODO Make models use mailers through this._modelExtras
*** TODO Update tests
** TODO Update models to use this._container for other models usage
** TODO Update all Installation tests to use DomainContainers (for convenience)
** TODO PATOS-88
** TODO TESTS
